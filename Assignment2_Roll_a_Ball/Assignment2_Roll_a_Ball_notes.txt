Hello,
This is the second game development project, mainly incorporating the project "Roll-a-Ball."

We were assigned to add several different features on our games including:
- A toggle to "oversize the ball," enlarging the player sphere.
- A slider to change the speed of the player
- A dropdown to change the color of the player sphere
- A pause menu that pauses the game.
- And to Add 2 additional scenes, making it 3 in total.

As required, I have 3 scenes total. However, the first scene has two panels.

The first panel is simply the "welcome" panel while the second panel is the "options" panel. 

Pressing the Oversize Ball? toggle changes the size of the sphere from being normal or large. 

The Game Speed slider has a range from 1 to 5, representing the speed values of the player.

And as expected, the dropdown has a selection of colors for the ball.

To access the data from this scene to the next, I used PlayerPrefs variables to save the settings to be used during the game.

Now it's time to play the game!

If I press the "Escape Key," then it brings up a pause menu, which has buttons to Resume, Return to Menu, or to Quit the game entirely. Pressing Escape also goes back to the game.

Now lets complete the objective!

Nice! This is the final scene, presenting options to either return to the first scene or to quit the game.

Let's restart and show off some of the other settings. Let's change the color, the size, and the speed.

There we go! And that is the roll a ball game.
